Netflix Movie Recommendation System â€“ Project Overview

This project is aimed at creating a content-based movie recommendation system for Netflix titles that will recommend movies to users based on their preferences. The main goal is to improve the user experience by suggesting movies that are contextually or thematically close to one movie a user already enjoys watching. The dataset employed, `netflix_titles.csv`, contains metadata like the title, genre (`listed_in`), and description of every piece of content found on Netflix, making it particularly suitable for content-based filtering algorithms.

The initial phase of the project is data preprocessing and cleaning, which is critical for providing high-quality input to the recommendation engine. The duplicate records are deleted based on movie names to eliminate redundant recommendations. Furthermore, the `title`, `listed_in`, and `description` columns have their leading and trailing whitespaces removed, which helps cleanse the data. Missing values in the `listed_in` and `description` columns are replaced with empty strings to preserve the structure and consistency needed for vectorization methods.

In the subsequent phase, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted to know the dataset well. Although the notebook does not display this, common EDA would involve extracting frequently occurring genres, monitoring content type distribution (TV shows vs. movies), and checking keyword frequency in descriptions. These results do not only facilitate user preference understanding but also confirm the appropriateness of data for constructing a recommendation system.

The foundation of the project is in the similarity calculation and feature engineering process. To construct a content-based recommender, the textual information from various columns like `title`, `listed_in`, and `description` are combined into one text corpus per movie. By applying the TF-IDF vectorization, this text data is transformed into numerical vectors representing the significance of individual words in the document with decreased weight of frequently used words. After vectorization, cosine similarity is applied to determine the similarity score among all pairs of movies. This method aids in the identification of movies with common contextual or thematic aspects.

Lastly, the system allows users to enter a name of a movie, and then it returns a list of top N most similar ones in terms of their TF-IDF vector representation. The benefit of content-based filtering is that it does not need user rating history, so it is suitable for systems with not so much user interaction data. Nevertheless, the system does have disadvantages such as the "cold start" issue for brand new content and no personalization beyond textual similarity.

Overall, this project provides a strong and interpretable recommendation system based on traditional natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and TF-IDF. It is a baseline model that can be enhanced in future versions with hybrid strategies, adding collaborative filtering or **deep learning models for better accuracy and user personalization.
